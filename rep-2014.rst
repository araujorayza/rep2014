Abstract
========

This REP describes some principles and guidelines for benchmarking performance in ROS 2. It's intended to be a living document that can be updated as new information becomes available.


Motivation
==========

Benchmarking is the act of running a computer program to assess its relative performance. In the context of ROS 2, performance must be studied with real examples and measurements on real robotic computations, rather than simply as a collection of definitions, designs and/or marketing actions. The quantitative approach [1]_ to robotics systems architecture fits well in this context and helps robotic architects come up with better performing architectures through an empirical strategy.
